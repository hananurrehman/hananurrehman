I identify as an investigative analytical thinker who likes to challange the norms and doubt the (not so)obvious.

I have the experience of testing software in various business domains like tech startups, real estate, enterprise resource planning, SaaS products and the current CMMS product. 

I'm always up for contributing on open source projects to:
1. Test
2. Generate test reports
3. Write test automation scripts
4. Verify bug fixes

So hit me up if you have an interesting project ðŸ˜‰ 

Currently I'm researching [Data Masking with Py-Mongo](https://github.com/hananurrehman/data-masking-demo) and exploring [Pimify](https://github.com/hananurrehman/pimify)
