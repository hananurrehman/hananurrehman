![Software tester](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hananurrehman/hananurrehman/main/github-header-image2.png)

A software tester with over 6 years of experience, I bring an investigative & analytical thought process to the table that drives context driven test strategies. 
What sets me apart? A skill set that includes scripting, exploring, experimenting and automating to grow a test strategy that covers the greatest possible scope of the software (and hardware if it's IoT). I have had the opportunity to work on software solutions that span over a very broad set of industries, which gives me the edge of having vast business domain knowledge.

I can work in a team, I can work with a sole responsibility, I can work with your XYZ process; I'm adaptable!
