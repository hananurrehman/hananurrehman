I'm a strong proponent of context driven testing. Over the past 4+ years I have worked on several projects which gives me a broader knowledge of software scope in today's age.
My testing approach is more inclined towards performing a thorough investigation of the software to evaluate it's state, thus helping the stakeholders make informed decisions.
I'm an admirer of the Rapid Software Testing school of thought.
